   - "EDITSCAPE" text around the top
   - "SCULPTING YOUR VISION INTO REALITY" around the bottom
   - Clapperboard graphic in the center with "time for VIDEO" text

### 2. Save Your Profile Image
1. Save your profile photo as: `public/lovable-uploads/aarpita-profile.png`
2. This should be the portrait of Aarpita Mehta in the brown coat with green background

- **Size**: Recommended 300x300px or larger for logo, 400x400px or larger for profile
- **Location**: Save directly in the `public/lovable-uploads/` folder

### 4. After Saving

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add original logo and profile images"
git push origin main
```
